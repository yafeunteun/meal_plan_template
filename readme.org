* Meal Plan Template

*Goal:* Generate a PDF from data describing a meal plan. The PDF layout is defined using CSS and rendered with PDFKit. 

I'm also using Flask to trigger the PDF generation via http to integrate it onto my website.


** Usage 

1. Run the Flask app 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python app/main.py
#+END_SRC
2. Go to [[http://localhost:5000/]] to trigger PDF generation.
3. Alternatively you can go to [[http://localhost:5000/test]] to render the html without generating the PDF.
